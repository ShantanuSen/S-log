About Sony S-log system

Abstract - Modern image sensors can acquire more data than previous due to increased bit depth. 
But storage devices and display devices do not support up to that bit depth. 
Alongside with this, to produce or capture HDR images it is also important to preserve the sensor native data as much as it can. 
These intentions motivate the introduction of log-encoding idea in imaging devices. 
Log-encoding saves storage as well as keeps roughly exact information from image sensor. 
Different camera manufacturing companies developed their own log-curve and color gamut for their products. 
In this paper, we discuss about the S-log curve which was developed by Sony. 
The discussion includes S-log curve types, workflow, example of output images and color gamut in brief.
